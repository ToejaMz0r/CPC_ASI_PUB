Installation
We recommend you install to the default location.

For any settings that need editing, right click the shortcut that is created and press edit. All settings have notes above them and are easy to change.

Once installed, run once, watch for errors. See the thread here for how to fix any errors that occur.

If you change installation location
You can change the location this is installed to, if you do this you will need to edit the location of your nircmd.exe inside the batch file which is very simple to do.

Arma 2 OA Location
If your Arma 2 location is not this:

"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\ARMA 2 Operation Arrowhead"

You will need to change it inside the batch file.

Everything else is optional

Everything else is optional, by default it is set to connect to our DayZ Epoch Chernarus #1 server.
